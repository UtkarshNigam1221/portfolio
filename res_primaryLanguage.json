      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Utkarsh Nigam, a passionate and innovative software developer with over 4 years of experience in building scalable web and mobile applications. I specialize in backend development, cloud infrastructure, and creating seamless user experiences using technologies like Java, C#, Python, Spring, React, AWS, and Azure. Currently, I'm working at Microsoft in the Dataverse team for Dynamics 365 FnO, where I focus on data import/export systems and use automation and AI to reduce operational noise and improve SLA metrics. Previously, I was at Amazon, where I played a key role in designing and launching a notifications service used by clients to manage, schedule, and monitor messages with high reliability and usability. Beyond work, I enjoy exploring topics in machine learning, data science, and system design. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and love mentoring others, solving complex problems, and contributing to impactful products.",

        "description": "Wavelet trees are used to separate sound frequencies by decomposing a signal into different frequency bands through a series of filters and decimation. Each node in the tree represents a specific frequency range, with low-frequency components typically on the lower branches and high-frequency components on the upper branches. This process allows for a detailed analysis of the signal's frequency content and its temporal location. We worked on parallelization of the whole process by distributing the subtree process to worker threads and applying optimal compression logic to solve the problem in optimal space and time.",
