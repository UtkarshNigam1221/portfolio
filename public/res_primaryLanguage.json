      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Utkarsh Nigam, a passionate and innovative software developer with over 4 years of experience in building scalable web and mobile applications. I specialize in backend development, cloud infrastructure, and creating seamless user experiences using technologies like Java, C#, Python, Spring, React, AWS, and Azure. Currently, I'm working at Microsoft in the Dataverse team for Dynamics 365 FnO, where I focus on data import/export systems and use automation and AI to reduce operational noise and improve SLA metrics. Previously, I was at Amazon, where I played a key role in designing and launching a notifications service used by clients to manage, schedule, and monitor messages with high reliability and usability. Beyond work, I enjoy exploring topics in machine learning, data science, and system design. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and love mentoring others, solving complex problems, and contributing to impactful products.",
